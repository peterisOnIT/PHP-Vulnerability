# The challenge is to analyze, ethically exploit, and mitigate vulnerabilities in PHP scriptsâ€¯running on a Linux virtual machine. 

 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup the Environment
Download and Import the VM:
Download the vuln_ictf2014_64_1.ova file.
Import the VM into VirtualBox.
Configure Networking:
Set up a Host-Only Adapter for the VM to communicate with the host machine.
Ensure the VM acquires an IP address in the range "192.168.56.1/24" Mine was 56.104 for the VM


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Locate and Analyze PHP Scripts
Find PHP Scripts:
Use find / -name *.php to list all PHP scripts on the VM.
Focus on scripts located in /var/ctf/music-copyright/html/cgi-bin/

I will examine scripts like account.php, upload.php, login.php, etc., for common vulnerabilities such as file inclusion, SQL injection, command injection
