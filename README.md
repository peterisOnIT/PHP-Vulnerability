# The challenge is to analyze, ethically exploit, and mitigate vulnerabilities in PHP scriptsâ€¯running on a Linux virtual machine. 

 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup the Environment
Download and Import the VM:
Download the vuln_ictf2014_64_1.ova file.
Import the VM into VirtualBox.
Configure Networking:
Set up a Host-Only Adapter for the VM to communicate with the host machine.
Ensure the VM acquires an IP address in the range "192.168.56.1/24" Mine was 56.104 for the VM


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Locate and Analyze PHP Scripts
Find PHP Scripts:
Use find / -name *.php to list all PHP scripts on the VM.
Focus on scripts located in /var/ctf/music-copyright/html/cgi-bin/

I will examine scripts like account.php, upload.php, login.php, etc., for common vulnerabilities such as file inclusion, SQL injection, command injection

did not like it so I will create an account and I will try to upload the php file to access

If I access to exact path of the uploaded file (/var/ctf/music-copyright/html/cgi-bin/uploads/test.php),

This seems to be working If I put wrong address

will show up like this ![image](https://github.com/peterisOnIT/PHP-Vulnerability/assets/117600297/3e1182ea-f462-4378-b795-32b2303b0baa)


I will be accessing with expolit php file I create and will try to access to password etc/passwd
