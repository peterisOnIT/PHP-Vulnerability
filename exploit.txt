Exploit Description:

The vulnerability identified is an unrestricted file upload flaw in the upload functionality. By uploading a malicious PHP script (`test.php`), an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

Steps to Exploit:
1. Register a new account.
2. Log in with the created account.
3. Upload a PHP shell (`test.php`).
4. Access the uploaded shell and execute commands.

Mitigation Plan:

1. Input Validation:
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent malicious payloads.

2. Restrict File Uploads:
   - Only allow specific file types (e.g., images) and validate file contents.

3. Use Prepared Statements:
   - Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

4. Secure File Storage:
   - Store uploaded files outside the web root and use randomized file names.

5. Disable Command Execution:
   - Ensure that uploaded files cannot be executed as scripts.
